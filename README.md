# Algorithm-Design

In this course, students will be familiarized with the fundamentals of algorithm design, programming from algorithms, advanced data structures, time complexity of algorithms, and several different algorithms including greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, backtracking, branch-and-bound, among others.

Objectives

The objectives of students taking this course are to learn: (a) how to design different types of algorithms; (b) the different approaches in designing algorithms; (c) how to compare different algorithms for implementing the solution to the same problem; (d) advanced data structures; and (d) how to estimate the time complexity of an algorithm both theoretically and experimentally.
